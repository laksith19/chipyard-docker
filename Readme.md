## Chipyard Docker Images

** These are unoffical docker builds not affiliated with the Chipyard project.** Please limit any issues you run into while using these images to this repository.

## Current Status

As of right now this is a custom image specifically tailored to fit the needs of the Spring 2024 offering of CS152. I might decide to support a more general build in the future. 

These images have also only been tested on x86 machines, so if you've got an Apple Silicon Mac or another Arm based machine this image might not function correctly. 

## Usage

Ensure that you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your machine before proceeding.
